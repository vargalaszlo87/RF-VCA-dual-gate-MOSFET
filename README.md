# üöÄ RF-VCA-dual-gate-MOSFET
Voltage Controlled Amplifier with dual-gate MOSFET for FlexRadio project, but you can also use it independently. This wideband unit can be used as the first stage of an MW / SW radio. I hope the circuit and this description will helpful for you, try it in LTSpice and build it for your fun. :)

# ‚≠ê The circuit

This circuit has two classical parts, but it has many useful functions for example Over-Voltage Protection.

## The first part

In this configuration, this circuit can also be used with a stick or long wire antenna in range 0.5MHz to 10.0MHz. Therefore, we must pay close attention for electrostatic discharges and any high input voltage because the pins of FETs are very sensitive. See it:

Simple but very important. The change of the most
